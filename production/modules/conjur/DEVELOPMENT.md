# Publishing the module to Puppet Forge

To release a new version of the module to the Puppet Forge:

1. Update the `version` field in [metadata.json](metadata.json).
2. Update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
3. Commit and push these changes.
4. Create a tag and push it (`git tag <VERSION> && git push --tags`)
5. Run [release.sh](release.sh).
6. View the updated module: https://forge.puppet.com/cyberark/conjur

You must be connected to conjurops v2 to fetch the secrets used to publish.

# Running services locally

## Running a Conjur server locally

Run a preconfigured Conjur instance with `docker-compose up -d`.
Username is 'admin', password is 'secret'. The HTTPS endpoint is mapped to port `9443`.
Once the server is running, view the UI at [localhost:9443/ui](https://localhost:9443/ui).
You can ignore the cert warning; a self-signed cert is used.

## Running a Puppet master locally

Run a Puppet master with `./puppet-master.sh`. This script wraps running `docker-compose.puppet.yml`, where
all services needed to run the master are defined. The `code` directory in this project is mounted
onto the master at `/etc/puppetlabs/code/`. Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the Puppet Dashboard.
You can stop and remove all services with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.puppet.yml down`.

## Running a Puppet node locally

Puppet [provides Docker images](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-in-docker#description)
that make running ephemral Puppet agents pretty easy.

For example, once the Puppet master is up you can run this to converge an agent:

```sh-session
$ docker run --rm --net puppet_default puppet/puppet-agent-ubuntu
```

You will see Puppet converge on the node.

A couple notes:

1. docker-compose creates the `puppet_default` network by default. The agent needs to connect to this
   network to be able to see the Puppet master.
2. The default command for these agent images is `agent --verbose --one-time --no-daemonize --summarize`.
   The default entrypoint is `/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet `.
   This can easily be overridden for your purposes, e.g.

   ```sh-session
   $ docker run --rm --net puppet_default \
     puppet/puppet-agent-ubuntu apply --modulepath=$PWD examples/init.pp
   ```

   Note that if you want to run manifests directly then need to be mounted into the container.

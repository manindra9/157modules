## Description

This is the official Puppet module for [Conjur](https://www.conjur.org), a robust identity and access management platform. This module simplifies the operations of establishing Conjur host identity and allows authorized Puppet nodes to fetch secrets from Conjur.

## Setup

### Setup Requirements

This module requires that you have a Conjur endpoint available to the Puppet nodes using this module.

### Beginning with conjur

This module provides a `conjur::secret` function that can be used to retrieve secrets from Conjur. Given a Conjur variable identifier, `conjur::secret` uses the node’s Conjur identity to resolve and return the variable’s value.

```puppet
$dbpass = conjur::secret('production/postgres/password')
```

Hiera attributes can also be used to inform which secret should be fetched, depending on the node running the Conjur module. For example, if `hiera('domain')` returns `app1.example.com` and a Conjur variable named `domains/app1.example.com/ssl-cert` exists, the SSL certificate can be retrieved and written to a file like so:

```puppet
file { '/etc/ssl/cert.pem':
  content   => conjur::secret("domains/%{hiera('domain')}/ssl-cert"),
  ensure    => file
  show_diff => false # only required for Puppet < 4.6
  # diff will automatically get redacted in 4.6 if content is Sensitive
}
```

#### Sensitive data type (Puppet >= 4.6)

Note in Puppet >= 4.6 `conjur::secret` returns values wrapped
in a `Sensitive` data type. In some contexts, such as string interpolation,
it might cause surprising results (interpolating to `Sensitive [value redacted]`).
This is intentional, as it makes it harder to accidentally mishandle secrets.

To use a secret as a string, you need to explicitly request it using the
`unwrap` function; the result of the processing should be again wrapped in
a `Sensitive` value.

In particular, you should not pass unwrapped secrets as resource parameters
if you can avoid it. Many resource types support `Sensitive` data type and
handle it correctly. If a resource you're using does not, file a bug.

```puppet
$dbpass = conjur::secret('production/postgres/password')

# In Puppet 4.6, use Sensitive data type to handle anything sensitive
$db_yaml = Sensitive("password: ${dbpass.unwrap}")

file { '/etc/someservice/db.yaml':
  content => $db_yaml, # this correctly handles both Sensitive and String
  ensure  => file,
  mode    => '0600', # remember to limit reading
}
```

## Usage

This module provides the `conjur::secret` function, described above, and the `conjur` class, which can be configured to establish Conjur host identity on the node running Puppet.

### Pre-established host identity

For best security properties, use [conjurize](https://developer.conjur.net/key_concepts/machine_identity.html) or a similar method to establish host identity before running Puppet to configure. This way Puppet master only ever handles a temporary access token instead of real, permanent Conjur credentials of the hosts it manages.

If a host is so pre-configured, the settings and credentials are automatically obtained and used. In this case, all that is needed to use `conjur::secret` is a simple

```puppet
include conjur
```

### Conjur host identity with Host Factory

If pre-establishing host identity is unfeasible, we instead recommend bootstrapping Conjur host identity using a [Host Factory](https://developer.conjur.net/reference/services/host_factory) token. Nodes inherit the permissions of the layer for which the Host Factory token was generated.

To use a Host Factory token with this module, set variables `authn_login` and `host_factory_token`. Do not set the variable `authn_api_key` when using `host_factory_token`; it is not required. `authn_login` should have a `host/` prefix; the part after the slash will be used as the node’s name in Conjur.

```puppet
class { conjur:
  account            => 'mycompany',
  appliance_url      => 'https://conjur.mycompany.com/',
  authn_login        => 'host/redis001',
  host_factory_token => Sensitive('3zt94bb200p69nanj64v9sdn1e15rjqqt12kf68x1d6gb7z33vfskx'),
  ssl_certificate    => file('/etc/conjur.pem')
  version            => 5,
}
```

By default, all nodes using this Puppet module to bootstrap identity with host_factory_token will have the following annotation set:

```yaml
puppet: true
```

### Conjur host identity with API key

For one-off hosts or test environments it may be preferable to create a host in Conjur and then directly assign its Conjur identity in this module.

```puppet
class { conjur:
  appliance_url   => 'https://conjur.mycompany.com/',
  authn_login     => 'host/redis001',
  authn_api_key   => Sensitive('f9yykd2r0dajz398rh32xz2fxp1tws1qq2baw4112n4am9x3ncqbk3'),
  ssl_certificate => file('/conjur-ca.pem')
  version         => 5,
}
```

### Conjur Enterprise Edition

If you're using this module to establish host identity with Conjur Enterprise
Edition version 4.x, you should use `version => 4`. (This is also the default
for backwards compatibility reasons.) Also note that the `appliance_url` will
need to include the `/api/` suffix.

For example:

```puppet
class { conjur:
  appliance_url      => 'https://conjur.mycompany.com/api/',
  authn_login        => 'host/redis001',
  host_factory_token => Sensitive('3zt94bb200p69nanj64v9sdn1e15rjqqt12kf68x1d6gb7z33vfskx'),
  ssl_certificate    => file('/etc/conjur.pem')
  version            => 4,
}
```

## Reference

### Classes

#### Public Classes

* `::conjur`

### Functions

#### Public Functions

* `conjur::secret`

### `::conjur`

This class establishes Conjur host identity on the node so that secrets can be fetched from Conjur. The identity and Conjur endpoint configuration can be pre-configured on a host using `/etc/conjur.conf` and `/etc/conjur.identity` or provided as parameters. The identity can also be bootstrapped using a host factory token.

#### Note

Several parameters (ie. API keys) are of `Sensitive` data type on Puppet >= 4.6.
To pass a normal string, you need to wrap it using `Sensitive("example")`.

#### Parameters

##### `account`
Conjur account authority name. Optional for v4, required for v5.

##### `appliance_url`
A Conjur endpoint (with trailing `/api` for v4).

##### `authn_login`
User username or host name (prefixed with `host/`).

##### `authn_api_key`
API key for a user or host. Must be `Sensitive` if supported.

##### `ssl_certificate`
Content of the X509 certificate of the root CA of Conjur, PEM formatted.
When using Puppet's `file` function, the path to the cert must be absolute.

##### `host_factory_token`
You can use a host factory token to obtain a host identity. Must be `Sensitive` if supported.
Simply use this parameter to set it. The host record will be created in Conjur.

##### `authn_token`
Raw (unencoded) Conjur token. This is usually only useful for testing.
Must be `Sensitive` if supported.

##### `version`
Conjur API version. Should be set to 5 unless you're using Conjur Enterprise 4.x.

Defaults to 4 for backward compatibility reasons. (This will change in a future version.)

#### Examples

```puppet
# use a pre-existing Conjur configuration host identity
include conjur

# using an host factory token
class { conjur:
  appliance_url      => 'https://conjur.mycompany.com/',
  authn_login        => 'host/redis001',
  host_factory_token => Sensitive('f9yykd2r0dajz398rh32xz2fxp1tws1qq2baw4112n4am9x3ncqbk3'),
  ssl_certificate    => file('conjur-ca.pem')
  version            => 5,
}

# same, but /etc/conjur.conf and certificate are already on a host
# (eg. baked into a base image)
class { conjur:
  authn_login        => 'host/redis001',
  host_factory_token => Sensitive('f9yykd2r0dajz398rh32xz2fxp1tws1qq2baw4112n4am9x3ncqbk3'),
}

# using an API key
class { conjur:
  account         => 'mycompany',
  appliance_url   => 'https://conjur.mycompany.com/',
  authn_login     => 'host/redis001',
  authn_api_key   => Sensitive('f9yykd2r0dajz398rh32xz2fxp1tws1qq2baw4112n4am9x3ncqbk3'),
  ssl_certificate => file('conjur-ca.pem')
  version         => 5,
}
```

### `conjur::secret`

This function uses the node’s Conjur host identity to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve a secret that the node is authorized to fetch. The output of this function is a string that contains the value of the variable parameter. If the secret cannot be fetched an error is thrown.

The returned value is `Sensitive` data type if supported (see notes above).

#### Parameters

##### `variable`
The identifier of a Conjur variable to retrieve.

#### Example

```puppet
dbpass = conjur::secret('production/postgres/password')
```
